# DO-NEW-NET
This was a system that was built supposedly from scratch.  PLEASE READ the read-me..


 I have all the files and Database. I have a hosted Server as well as a Personal Server. I would like to ask someone for help on restructuring this system I have the original drawings of the concept how it worked, and I'm willing to work with a small team.
 The basics, PHP, MySQL, Java SCRIPT, *.tpl files Apache and how a Front-Side works along with a Back-End Administrator side.
 
 This is a long story what happened. How I messed up, Trust issues, Just everything. Most of all 1&1 Hosting FU%^#$ED me hard,
 I was stupid to agree on having a VPS not a shared one but than you never know at least back than. Well 1 year into development and hosting Websites among that side project the server got hit with a DoSS somehow we got back up in 14 hours keep in mind 
 we are talking about 3 people that live 9 hour air plain rides away. The Support with 1and1 could not be worse than it was.
 The entire time I thought that everything was set for off-site back up. My Server guy knew his shit. My role was to get clients and Wire Frame the site meet with clients etc. and last but not least The Programmer who said after going through 7 other programmers said he programs. later to find out that Yes he programs but has a company a partner and few programmers on the side while him keeping up with a normal job. Till today I know that many areas of this are grey and I invested my own money into this.
 The concept, idea, long hours of language barriers.
 
 Look this would be a Thesis to write. I'm here to find a 3 man crew. I spent 4 months going into raw data files to recovery files but managed to get 99.9% of all files back and 5 full DATABASES with data. More will be explained once I see that I have at least one person interested and we talk over phone. No money, just to figure out how to create a free version But modularize functions for mid-sized Businesses to Large Corporate entities.
